  The Code Jam 2021 World Finals took place virtually for the second year in a row.
  But that did not stop the judges from crafting challenging problems,
  nor the contestants from tackling them in formidable manner.
  Unlike the last few editions, the difficulty curve was a steep one and the
  problem scores reflected that. <i>Cutting Cake</i> was a relatively
  straightforward (for the Finals) geometry problem, which ended up requiring some
  algebra as well. <i>Slide Circuits</i> was a graph problem only on the surface,
  but solving it was all about data structures and hashing techniques.
  <i>Ropes</i> marked the return of interactive problems to the Finals after a
  one year absence. It rewarded both creative ad-hoc insights and careful research.
  <i>Divisible Divisions</i> was a regular dynamic programming problem that became
  heavily arithmetic once the size got bigger for Test Set 2. Finally,
  <i>Infinitree</i> was a multi-step problem requiring graph theory and arithmetic insights,
  careful on-paper work, and a meticulous, if short, implementation.

  <b>ainta</b> was the first to secure some points just 12 minutes in by solving Test Set 1
  of Divisible Divisions.
  <b>Radewoosh</b> was the first to solve a full problem by cracking Slide Circuits
  just 18 minutes in. They followed this up by being the first to solve Divisible Divisions
  in just over 40 minutes. Between these two submissions, <b>Benq</b> solved Cutting Cake
  35 minutes in.
  <b>wxh010910</b> was the first to grab all the points for Ropes in just under two hours.
</p><p>
  This year's round was an incredible nail-biter. With half an hour left, more than ten
  contestants had the possibility to jump into first place by solving just a single problem.
  Even in the last minute, a full solve of Infinitree would have secured the championship
  for eight contestants.
  <b>wxh010910</b> was the first to fully solve Ropes, and they went on to solve two full
  problems and a partial problem after that
  to become the 2021 Code Jam Champion! Congratulations! They were the only one to score
  160 points, which is all problems except the hard part of Infinitree&mdash;just incredible!
  The last ten minutes contained extremely exciting moments when two contestants jumped up
  to 145 points. <b>semiexp.</b> jumped up with just 13 seconds left in the contest to
  finish in second place and <b>scottwu</b> finished in third less than six penalty minutes behind.

  This is it for Code Jam 2021! Congratulations to all participants for raising
  the problem-solving bar higher every year. We hope you enjoyed the contest
  as much as we enjoyed putting it together. We've already started writing and testing some
  intriguing problems for 2022, so we hope you'll come back for more (and bring your friends).
  If the algorithmist in you cannot possibly wait that long, you can keep practicing
  with all the problems in our

  rounds.
  See you next year!
