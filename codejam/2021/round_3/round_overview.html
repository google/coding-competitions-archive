  Round 3 started with <i>Build-A-Pair</i>, a punny but not puny problem
  that required the right greedy approach in order to save lots of casework,
  and the time that comes with it. As in most recent Round 3s,
  there was a significant step up in difficulty going into the second problem.
  <i>Square Free</i>, a problem a lot more appropriate this year than the past one,
  required a combination of graph theory, a clever ad-hoc insight, and iterative
  improvements to solve.
</p><p>
  Of course, the last two problems are where the key to getting to the finals was hidden.
  <i>Fence Design</i> was the always scary geometry problem. It could be solved in many
  different ways. Knowing your geometry theorems and algorithms could definitely put you
  on the right path, but all of them required the right customization to solve the problem.
  Finally, the path to solve <i>Binary Search Game</i> was hardly monotonic. The right model
  and usual game theory could get you some points, but some advanced arithmetic manipulation
  was needed for the full amount.
</p><p>
  There were a flurry of submissions for Build-A-Pair early in the contest, but it took several
  minutes until someone managed to get the full score. Square Free was also solved shortly
  afterwards, but it took 54 minutes for the first full solution to Binary Search Game to arrive,
  and over 75 minutes for Fence Design to get solved.
</p><p>
  Because there were a lot of partially correct solutions to the last two problems, the
  scoreboard jumped around a lot. <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b> was the only one to get to a full
  100 points for solid first place. <b>xll114514</b> and <b>Um_nik</b> rounded out the top 3
  by getting 81 points (all but Test Set 2 of Fence Design), and 12 other coders also managed
  to get to 81.
  In the end, a total of 683 people submitted something, with 601 of them getting points.
  The unofficial cutoff to get to the finals is 55 points and low enough penalty,
  which corresponds to solving the first two problems
  and Test Set 1 of the last two. Congratulations to all contestants for tackling such a hard
  set!

  In about two months, our finalists will face off in the World Finals! The Finals will take
  place virtually for a second year in a row. Finalist or not, everyone who advanced to Round 3
  will be able to remember their accomplishment by wearing the coveted Code Jam 2021 shirt!
  We will be sharing lots of video content during the finals, so please tune in
  to share the excitement with us!
