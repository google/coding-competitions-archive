Unusually for Code Jam, Round 1B happened on Sunday in a large part of the world, and even
early Monday in the eastern-most timezones. To make the timing even more strange, we started
off with a <i>Broken Clock</i> that required quite a bit of math to use it
to tell the time properly. It was a particularly challenging first problem for
a Round 1. Next up was the tricky <i>Subtransmutation</i>, which required
some combinatorial insights but could be solved quickly by following some mathematical
intuition and experimentation. The last problem was the interactive <i>Digit Blocks</i>,
that could be approached in multiple ways.

Because of the high difficulty floor of this round's problems, the first submission that
solved a full problem did not happen until after the 10 minute mark and less than 5000
coders managed to get some points out of more than 6600 that submitted.
The first perfect score
took 44 minutes, and gave <b>neal_wu</b> the first place in the round. <b>zscoder</b> and
<b>Egor</b> were the only others to get a perfect score with less than an hour of penalty,
rounding out the top 3. Ultimately, 183 coders managed a perfect score.
The unofficial cutoff is 31 points, which corresponds to solving Subtransmutation. There were
a lot of combinations of partial solutions that could get you over that score and into Round 2.

As usual, the Code Jam team will spend a few days finalizing the results. You can have fun
reading the analyses in the problem pages while you wait. Congratulations to all advancers,
and for everyone else, there is one more chance to advance to Round 2 in less than a week.
