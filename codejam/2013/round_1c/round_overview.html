<p>The last Round 1 again had an attendance in the vicinity of 5000 &mdash; pretty impressive, given that 2000 people already advanced. Our contestants were faced with a substring-counting problem Consonants, where to solve the large you had to deal with million-character names; followed by the tricky puzzle of Pogo and an implementation-intense problem called Great Wall.</p>

<p>The large input size in consonants caused the solutions of a large number of contestants to time out &mdash; quadratic solutions weren't cutting it, after all, and nearly 60% of contestants who attempted the large failed. The large of pogo was even more tricky &mdash; while for the small you could do some variation around exhaustive search, for the large you needed a few observations to come up with a greedy solution. Only 19% of contestants who attacked this problem succeeded. Finally, the Great Wall had a rather complex input that scared many people off, the first submission for the small came over half an hour into the contest; and the large required some variation on the theme of interval trees.</p>

<p>The competition was off to a blazing start, with xiaowuc1 solving the small of Consonants in an astounding time below two minutes! The other problems proved more problematic, however. In the end, it turned out that solving any one problem by itself was not enough to advance. The most popular way to get a spot in Round 2 was to deal with Consonants large and both remaining smalls, followed by dropping the Great Wall small in favor of doing the other problems really fast.</p>

<p>Congratulations to everybody who got through to Round 2, and we hope you enjoyed all the Round 1 problems!</p>
