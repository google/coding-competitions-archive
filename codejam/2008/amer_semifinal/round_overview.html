  For the admins, the big question in this contest was whether anyone would
  solve Problem D, King. Despite the confidence that you'll see in the problem's
  editorial, we strongly suspected that this would be the first problem in
  Google Code Jam 2008 that would go unsolved. The point value for its large
  dataset reflected our pessimism: it was worth as much as the other three
  larges put together!
</p><p>
  By the end of the contest, we had our answer: nobody had successfully solved
  D-large, and the AMER local onsites were our first match where nobody solved
  every problem. When we looked at some submissions, though, we found a story
  behind the scenes: <b>Ying</b>, with great determination and only slightly too
  much confidence, went for D immediately. Among the few attempts on D-large
  (others of which used random methods), his was the only one that hit on the
  key of the solution. Unfortunately a single error in a single line made his
  program fail on a single test case, and he was left with too little time to
  solve the other problems.
</p><p>
  The problems here were, in our view, the hardest among the three regional
  onsites, and every problem required some careful thinking or implementation.
  Only nine contestants submitted everything except D-large; some had minor
  errors, and only three solved all seven datasets. In the end
  <b>Bohua</b> claimed victory in this match, almost 8 minutes faster than
  second-place <b>SkidanovAlexander</b>.
