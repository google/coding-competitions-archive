  The Europe, Middle East and Asia regional semifinal round turned out to be the
  easiest of the three semifinals, with seven contestants solving all four
  problems. The top three spots went to <b>bmerry</b>, <b>dzhulgakov</b> and
  <b>gawry</b>. Coders from Eastern Europe dominated by taking 9 of the top 10
  spots. The competition was fierce, and the bar of advancing to the finals
  ended up at an unprecedented 50 points. For most of the top 43 contestants,
  that meant solving at least problems A, B and D-small. The problem set was a
  mix of different flavours of linear algebra and dynamic programming.
