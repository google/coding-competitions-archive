  This year's Code Jam to I/O for Women came later in the year than
  its <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejamio/archive" target="_blank">
  recent predecessors</a>, but it was hopefully worth the wait!
</p><p>
  The round started with <i>Impartial Offerings</i>, helping the budget-conscietious
  Aroha stay generous with her beloved pet friends. One small insight allowed contestants
  to get some points, and a second one was enough to solve the full problem greedily.
  <i>Inconstant Ordering</i> followed with a more abstract scenario, and this time the greedy
  strategy was less apparent, but more straightforward to code. There was larger leap in
  difficulty landing into the third problem, <i>Introductions Organization</i>, in which some
  clever graph modeling was needed. Finally, <i>Irrefutable Outcome</i> had three test sets:
  some careful brute force would get you a few points and applying some dynamic programming
  to it would get you some extra, but a thorough analysis of the game was needed to
  obtain the full score.
</p><p>
  <b>IloveShokupanman</b> was the first one to a perfect score (something that hasn't been achieved
  since 2017), and landed at the top of the scoreboard once the round concluded. <b>ITO444</b> came in
  with a super close second place finishing only 10 penalty seconds behind, and
  <b>giada</b> rounded out the top 3. In total, 10 people managed a perfect score. More than 5000
  people scored some points out of the more than 6600 that submitted a solution.
</p><p>
  Unfortunately, there was an incorrect limit in the Hidden test set of Introductions Organization,
  which we discovered only after the Hidden results were already revealed. The test data was
  corrected to match the statement that was displayed during the round.
  All affected solutions have been
  re-judged and points have been updated accordingly. As a result, ranks may change
  slightly from what was previously displayed.  We apologize for the confusion.
</p><p>
  We hope that Code Jam to I/O for Women 2021 was fun and challenging,
  and that everyone finished having learned something new. Congratulations to those
  in the top 150: you earned special tickets to virtual Google I/O 2021! You will be
  contacted by the team soon to claim your prize.
</p><p>
  We look forward to having everyone back again in 2022.
  Until then, the current

  season is in full swing, and you can also train and compete year round with
